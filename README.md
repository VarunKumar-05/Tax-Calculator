# Tax-Calculator
 it calculates tax based upon the spending history of the user and the source of income of the user
System Architecture
The application will have:
* React frontend with Tailwind CSS
* Express.js backend
* SQLite database (simple to set up for this project)
* Authentication system (JWT-based)
* Tax calculation logic
  
**Tax Calculator Web App Summary**
I've designed a comprehensive tax calculator web application that fulfills your requirements. Here's what the implementation includes:

**Backend Components**
Express.js server with RESTful API endpoints for user management, income data, purchases, and tax calculations
SQLite database for storing user information, income data, and purchase history
JWT-based authentication system with secure login/signup flow
Data validation and security measures for all API endpoints
Tax calculation logic that processes income and purchase data


**Frontend Components**
React application with responsive UI built using Tailwind CSS
Authentication pages (login and signup) with form validation
Dashboard showing tax summary and visualizations
Income management page for primary and additional income sources
Purchase history page with add/edit/delete functionality
Tax report page with calculation results and export options
The application follows a proper separation of concerns with user authentication, data persistence, and business logic handled by the backend, while the frontend provides an intuitive user experience for data entry and visualization.

Users can register accounts, log in securely, input their income and purchase data, and receive accurate tax calculations based on the implemented formulas. They can also export their tax reports and visualize their spending patterns relative to their tax obligations.
